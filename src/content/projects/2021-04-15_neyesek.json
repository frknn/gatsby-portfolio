  "desc": "A full stack recipe sharing app. You can share your recipes with a photo, search another recipes by name, filter by ingredients, maximum cook time and preparation time. You can also add recipes to your favorites and find them on your profile.\n\nNote: If app crashes the first time you launch, just refresh the page. It is because both of the application and API it consumes deployed on free tier. Heroku has a long cold start and Vercel doesn't wait more than 10 seconds for a function to respond on free tier.",
